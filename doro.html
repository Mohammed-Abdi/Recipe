        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>1. Prepare the Chicken</h3>
        <p>
          Wash the chicken pieces thoroughly and marinate with lemon juice and a
          pinch of salt. Set aside.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Cook the Onions</h3>
        <p>
          In a large pot, cook the onions over medium heat without oil until
          soft and slightly caramelized. Stir constantly to avoid burning.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Add Aromatics</h3>
        <p>
          Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and Niter Kibbeh. Stir well for
          about 2 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Incorporate Berbere Spice</h3>
        <p>
          Add the berbere spice blend and cook for another 2 minutes, stirring
          continuously to release its aroma.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Mix Tomato Paste and Stock</h3>
        <p>
          Stir in the tomato paste and chicken stock, ensuring everything is
          well combined. Let it simmer for 5 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Add Chicken</h3>
        <p>
          Place the marinated chicken pieces into the pot, coating them
          thoroughly with the sauce. Cover and simmer on low heat for 30–40
          minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Add Eggs</h3>
        <p>
          Peel the hard-boiled eggs and make small slits on their sides. Add
          them to the stew during the last 10 minutes of cooking.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Season and Serve</h3>
        <p>
          Adjust salt to taste and serve the Doro Wat hot with injera or rice.
