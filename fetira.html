        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>1. Prepare the Dough</h3>
        <p>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Gradually add the warm water, stirring to form a dough. Knead until smooth, about 5-7 minutes. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</p>

        <h3>2. Roll Out the Dough</h3>
        <p>Divide the dough into small portions. Roll each portion into a thin, round sheet, as thin as possible without tearing.</p>

        <h3>3. Layer and Fold</h3>
        <p>Brush each rolled dough with melted butter or oil. Stack the sheets on top of each other, folding the edges in to form a rectangular or square shape. You can repeat this process for multiple layers to make the flatbread crispy and flaky.</p>

        <h3>4. Cook the Fetira</h3>
        <p>Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium heat. Place the layered dough in the pan and cook for about 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and crispy.</p>

        <h3>5. Optional: Brush with Egg</h3>
        <p>If you like, brush the cooked Fetira with a beaten egg for a glossy finish.</p>

        <h3>6. Serve</h3>
        <p>Serve warm with honey, eggs, or yogurt, and enjoy!</p>
