        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>1. Sauté the Onions and Garlic</h3>
        <p>Heat butter or oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, sautéing until softened and golden, about 5–7 minutes.</p>

        <h3>2. Add Tomatoes and Spices</h3>
        <p>Add chopped tomatoes, turmeric, and berbere. Stir well and cook for another 5 minutes, allowing the tomatoes to break down.</p>

        <h3>3. Cook the Meat</h3>
        <p>Add the cubed meat (beef, lamb, or chicken) to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is browned and cooked through, about 10–15 minutes.</p>

        <h3>4. Add Green Chili (Optional)</h3>
        <p>If you like extra spice, add the sliced green chili peppers and cook for another 2-3 minutes.</p>

        <h3>5. Season and Serve</h3>
        <p>Season with salt to taste and serve your Tibs hot with injera or rice.</p>
