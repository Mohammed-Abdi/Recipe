        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>1. Prepare the Meat</h3>
        <p>Finely mince the beef. If you prefer cooked Kitfo, lightly sauté the meat until browned. For raw Kitfo, ensure the beef is very fresh and clean.</p>

        <h3>2. Prepare the Niter Kibbeh</h3>
        <p>In a small pan, melt the Niter Kibbeh over low heat and add the berbere and cardamom powder. Stir and cook for 2-3 minutes to infuse the spices into the butter.</p>

        <h3>3. Combine Meat and Spices</h3>
        <p>Mix the minced beef with the spiced Niter Kibbeh, adding salt to taste. If you're using cooked meat, ensure the mixture is well combined and warmed through.</p>

        <h3>4. Serve</h3>
        <p>Serve Kitfo with injera, and optionally top with a small amount of gomen (steamed greens) or ayib (Ethiopian cheese) for added flavor.</p>
